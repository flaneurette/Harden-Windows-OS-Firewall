# Harden-Windows-OS-Firewall
A Powershell script that hardens firewall rules for Windows OS, and disables many things. Be sure to manually check the file (and possibly translate certain feature names if your locale is different. Currently only supports English/Dutch)

Run this command in Windows Powershell (as administrator), navigate to the location of the harden.ps1 file and type: 

> powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\harden.ps1
