# Harden-Windows-OS-Firewall
A Powershell script that hardens firewall rules for Windows OS, and disables many things. Be sure to manually check the file (and possibly translate certain feature names if your locale is different. Currently only supports English/Dutch)

Run it in Windows Powershell (as administrator): 

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\harden.ps1
